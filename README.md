# AFE4404-Library
Micropython based AFE4404-Library

Hello, I am a freshman in using AFE4404. Unlike other AFE4404 libraries, this library is written by python. 
I defined the basic functions for using AFE4404 in the afe.py file.
In main.py, Pyboard is connected to the AFE4404-SFH7060 board developed by myself, I will try to add more interesting functions, like detecting in vivo.
